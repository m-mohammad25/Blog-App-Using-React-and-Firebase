# Blog App Using React and Firebase (in progress)
In this project, I am applying on what I have learnt so far from <em>React.js</em> to make a blog app with the help of <em>Firebase</em> platform.<br>
The user can <em>create</em>, <em>update</em> and <em>delete</em> a post. In addion, they can <em>comment</em> on others' posts, and <em>like</em> or <em>dislike</em> a post.<br>
